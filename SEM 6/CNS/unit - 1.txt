# todo 4. Define Active and Passive attacks with Example.

    1. Active Attack:  
    An active attack occurs when an attacker modifies, alters, or disrupts the communication between two parties. The attacker tries to manipulate the transmitted data or system operations.  

    Examples of Active Attacks:  
    - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack: The attacker intercepts and modifies the communication between two parties.  
    - Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: The attacker floods a system with excessive requests to make it unavailable.  
    - Session Hijacking: The attacker takes over an active session between two parties.  

    Characteristics of Active Attacks:  
    - Data is altered or injected.  
    - Can be detected but not always prevented.  
    - Requires countermeasures like encryption and authentication.  

    ---

    2. Passive Attack:  
    A passive attack occurs when an attacker only monitors and listens to the communication without altering the data. The goal is to gather sensitive information without being detected.  

    Examples of Passive Attacks:  
    - Eavesdropping: The attacker secretly listens to a conversation or network communication.  
    - Traffic Analysis: The attacker analyzes patterns in network traffic to infer sensitive information.  
    - Shoulder Surfing: Physically observing someone’s screen or keyboard to steal information.  

    Characteristics of Passive Attacks:  
    - No modification of data occurs.  
    - Difficult to detect since communication remains unaffected.  
    - Can be prevented using encryption and secure communication channels.
