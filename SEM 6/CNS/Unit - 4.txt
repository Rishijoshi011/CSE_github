# todo: 1 What is IPSec? Briefly elaborate applications of IPSec.

A) IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) is a set of communication rules or protocols for setting
up secure connections over a network. It provides a set of security services, including data
confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication, to protect the confidentiality and
authenticity of data transmitted over the internet.

Applications:
● Secure branch office connectivity over the Internet: A company can build a secure
virtual private network over the Internet or over a public WAN. This enables a business to
rely heavily on the Internet and reduce its need for private networks, saving costs and
network management overhead.

● Secure remote access over the Internet: An end user whose system is equipped with IP
security protocols can make a local call to an Internet service provider and gain secure
access to a company network. This reduces the cost of toll charges for travelling
employees and telecommuters.

● Establishing extranet and intranet connectivity with partners: IPsec can be used to
secure communication with other organizations, ensuring authentication and
confidentiality and providing a key exchange mechanism.

● Enhancing electronic commerce security: Even though some Web and electronic
commerce applications have built-in security protocols, the use of IPsec enhances that
security.
