         Creating interactive dashboards using Tableau, Power BI.  
         Using Matplotlib & Seaborn for statistical plotting.  
    



3. Explain the relationship between Data Science and Big Data. What are the key characteristics (6Vs) of Big Data?

Data Science and Big Data are closely related, but they serve different purposes:

🔹 Big Data refers to large, complex datasets that traditional data processing tools cannot handle efficiently. It involves storing, processing, and managing vast amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data.

🔹 Data Science is the field that extracts meaningful insights from data using statistics, machine learning, and analytics. It helps in understanding and making sense of Big Data.

🔗 Relationship:
Big Data provides the raw material, while Data Science applies tools and techniques to extract valuable insights from it. Without Data Science, Big Data is just a vast collection of information with no useful meaning.

Key Characteristics of Big Data (6Vs)

Volume – The sheer size of data generated from sources like social media, IoT, and transactions.

Example: Facebook generates 4 petabytes of data daily.
Velocity – The speed at which data is generated and processed in real time.

Example: Stock market transactions happen in milliseconds.
Variety – Different data formats, such as structured (databases), semistructured (JSON, XML), and unstructured (videos, images).

Example: Emails, images, and sensor data.
Veracity – The accuracy and reliability of data.

Example: Social media data may have fake news or biases.
Value – The usefulness of data in decisionmaking.

Example: Companies analyze customer purchase patterns for personalized marketing.
Variability – The inconsistency of data due to timesensitive fluctuations.

Example: Ecommerce traffic spikes during Black Friday sales.
Visualization – The ability to represent complex data using graphs, dashboards, and charts.

Example: Google Analytics presents website traffic trends with interactive dashboards.



10.What is the role of Machine Learning in Data Science?  Differentiate between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. 

 Role of Machine Learning in Data Science  

Machine Learning (ML) plays a crucial role in Data Science by enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It is an essential tool in automating complex tasks and extracting meaningful insights from large datasets.  

 Key Roles of Machine Learning in Data Science:  
✅ Pattern Recognition – Identifies trends and hidden patterns in data.  
✅ Prediction & Forecasting – Used in stock price prediction, weather forecasting, etc.  
✅ Automation & Decision Making – Automates repetitive tasks like fraud detection.  
✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Enables applications like chatbots and sentiment analysis.  
✅ Personalization & Recommendations – Used in platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon.  



 Types of Machine Learning  

Machine Learning is broadly classified into three types:  

| Type            | Definition | Examples |
| Supervised Learning 🎯 | The model is trained on labeled data (inputoutput pairs). It learns to map inputs to correct outputs. | Spam detection, House price prediction, Medical diagnosis |
| Unsupervised Learning 🔍 | The model is trained on unlabeled data. It identifies patterns and groups similar data. | Customer segmentation, Market basket analysis, Anomaly detection |
| Reinforcement Learning 🎮 | The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on actions. | Robotics, Selfdriving cars, Game AI (Chess, Go) |



 Key Differences Between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning  

| Feature | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning |
| Data Type | Labeled Data (Has inputoutput pairs) | Unlabeled Data (No predefined labels) | Interaction with an environment |
| Goal | Learn a function that maps input to output | Find hidden patterns and structure in data | Learn optimal actions via rewards & penalties |
| Common Algorithms | Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks | KMeans, PCA, DBSCAN, Autoencoders | QLearning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), AlphaGo |
| Example Use Case | Email Spam Classification (Spam/Not Spam) | Customer Segmentation in Marketing | AIpowered Game Playing (Chess, Go, etc.) |
