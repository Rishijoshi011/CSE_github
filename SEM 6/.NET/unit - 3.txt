10.List out ADO.NET objects. Explain all the ADO.NET objects.

 ADO.NET Objects in ASP.NET  

ADO.NET is a data access technology in .NET that allows applications to interact with databases. It consists of several objects that help in retrieving, manipulating, and storing data.

---

 🔹 List of ADO.NET Objects:
1. Connection (`SqlConnection`)
2. Command (`SqlCommand`)
3. DataReader (`SqlDataReader`)
4. DataAdapter (`SqlDataAdapter`)
5. DataSet (`DataSet`)
6. DataTable (`DataTable`)
7. DataView (`DataView`)
8. Transaction (`SqlTransaction`)
9. Parameter (`SqlParameter`)
10. CommandBuilder (`SqlCommandBuilder`)

---

 🔹 Explanation of ADO.NET Objects:

 1️⃣ Connection Object (`SqlConnection`)
- Used to establish a connection between the application and the database.
- Requires a connection string to define the database location and credentials.

Example:
```csharp
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("server=localhost; database=MyDB; integrated security=true;");
conn.Open();
Console.WriteLine("Connection Established!");
conn.Close();
```

---

 2️⃣ Command Object (`SqlCommand`)
- Executes SQL queries (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
- Works with Stored Procedures.

Example:
```csharp
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT  FROM Employees", conn);
SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
```

---

 3️⃣ DataReader Object (`SqlDataReader`)
- Used to read data fast and forward-only (better for performance).
- Connected Architecture (requires an open connection).

Example:
```csharp
SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
while (reader.Read()) {
    Console.WriteLine(reader["Name"].ToString());
}
reader.Close();
```

---

 4️⃣ DataAdapter Object (`SqlDataAdapter`)
- Acts as a bridge between the `DataSet` and the database.
- Supports Disconnected Architecture (loads data into `DataSet`).

Example:
```csharp
SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT  FROM Employees", conn);
DataSet ds = new DataSet();
adapter.Fill(ds, "Employees");
```

---

 5️⃣ DataSet Object (`DataSet`)
- Stores multiple tables from the database.
- Works in disconnected mode (reduces database load).

Example:
```csharp
DataSet ds = new DataSet();
adapter.Fill(ds);
GridView1.DataSource = ds;
GridView1.DataBind();
```

---

 6️⃣ DataTable Object (`DataTable`)
- Represents a single table inside a `DataSet`.
- Can be used without connecting to a database.

Example:
```csharp
DataTable dt = ds.Tables["Employees"];
foreach (DataRow row in dt.Rows) {
    Console.WriteLine(row["Name"]);
}
```

---

 7️⃣ DataView Object (`DataView`)
- Provides a custom view of a `DataTable` (like filtering and sorting).

Example:
```csharp
DataView dv = new DataView(ds.Tables["Employees"]);
dv.RowFilter = "Department = 'HR'";
```

---

 8️⃣ Transaction Object (`SqlTransaction`)
- Ensures atomicity (all queries succeed or none apply).
- Used for banking systems, order placements, etc.

Example:
```csharp
SqlTransaction transaction = conn.BeginTransaction();
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 500 WHERE ID = 1", conn, transaction);
try {
    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    transaction.Commit();
} catch {
    transaction.Rollback();
}
```

---

 9️⃣ Parameter Object (`SqlParameter`)
- Prevents SQL injection by using parameterized queries.

Example:
```csharp
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT  FROM Employees WHERE Department = @dept", conn);
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@dept", "HR");
```

---

 🔟 CommandBuilder Object (`SqlCommandBuilder`)
- Auto-generates `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` SQL commands for a `DataAdapter`.

Example:
```csharp
SqlCommandBuilder builder = new SqlCommandBuilder(adapter);
adapter.Update(ds, "Employees");
```

---

 🔹 Summary Table
| Object | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|
| `SqlConnection` | Establishes connection to database |
| `SqlCommand` | Executes SQL queries |
| `SqlDataReader` | Reads data in a fast, forward-only way |
| `SqlDataAdapter` | Fills `DataSet` with data from the database |
| `DataSet` | Stores multiple tables and relations in memory |
| `DataTable` | Represents a single table |
| `DataView` | Provides sorting and filtering on `DataTable` |
| `SqlTransaction` | Ensures safe execution of multiple queries |
| `SqlParameter` | Protects against SQL injection |
| `SqlCommandBuilder` | Auto-generates commands for `DataAdapter` |

13.Write a note on Connected Data Access.

 Connected Data Access in ADO.NET

 🔹 What is Connected Data Access?
Connected Data Access refers to a method in ADO.NET where the database connection remains open while fetching and processing data. It is primarily used when real-time data retrieval is needed.

This approach is best suited for scenarios where you need to read large datasets quickly but do not need to modify them frequently.

---

 🔹 Key Features of Connected Data Access
1. Uses `SqlConnection` and `SqlCommand` to interact with the database.
2. Uses `SqlDataReader`, which provides a fast, forward-only way to read data.
3. Requires an active database connection during data retrieval.
4. Performs well for quick read-only operations but is not ideal for long transactions.
5. Does not store data in memory like `DataSet`, reducing memory consumption.

---

 🔹 Example of Connected Data Access in C
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        string connectionString = "server=localhost; database=MyDB; integrated security=true;";
        using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) {
            conn.Open();  // Open connection

            SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT Name, Age FROM Employees", conn);
            SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();  // Execute and get data

            while (reader.Read()) {
                Console.WriteLine("Name: " + reader["Name"] + ", Age: " + reader["Age"]);
            }

            reader.Close();
        }  // Connection automatically closed here due to 'using'
    }
}
```

---

 🔹 Advantages of Connected Data Access
✅ Fast Performance – Fetches data quickly using `SqlDataReader`.  
✅ Lower Memory Usage – Does not store the entire dataset in memory.  
✅ Efficient for Read-Only Operations – Ideal for reports, logs, and lists.  

---

 🔹 Disadvantages of Connected Data Access
❌ Requires an Open Connection – Can overload the database if many users access it simultaneously.  
❌ Not Suitable for Data Manipulation – Does not support editing like `DataSet`.  
❌ Limited to Forward-Only Access – Cannot move backward in records like `DataTable`.  

---

 🔹 When to Use Connected Data Access?
- When real-time data access is needed (e.g., displaying live reports).  
- When you are fetching a large dataset and don't need to modify it.  
- When memory usage is a concern, and you only need to read data quickly.  


14.Write difference between Manual Data binding, simple data binding,
complex data binding.

 Difference between Manual Data Binding, Simple Data Binding, and Complex Data Binding in ADO.NET

Data binding in ADO.NET refers to the process of connecting UI controls (like TextBox, DropDownList, GridView, ListBox, etc.) to a data source (like SQL Server, DataSet, List, etc.) to display or manipulate data.

There are three main types of data binding:
1. Manual Data Binding  
2. Simple Data Binding  
3. Complex Data Binding  

---

 🔹 1. Manual Data Binding
 Definition:  
- In manual data binding, data is retrieved from the database and assigned manually to a control using code.
- This provides full control over the data, but it requires more effort to implement.

 Example:
Binding data manually to a Label:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    string connectionString = "server=localhost; database=MyDB; integrated security=true;";
    using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) {
        conn.Open();
        SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE ID=1", conn);
        SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

        if (reader.Read()) {
            lblEmployeeName.Text = reader["Name"].ToString();  // Manually assigning data
        }
        reader.Close();
    }
}
```
 📝 Key Points:
✅ Provides full control over how and when data is loaded.  
✅ No automatic updates; must manually refresh data.  
❌ Requires more lines of code.  

---

 🔹 2. Simple Data Binding
 Definition:  
- Simple Data Binding is used when a single value from a data source is bound to a control.  
- It is commonly used for TextBox, Label, CheckBox, and DropDownList.

 Example:
Binding data to a TextBox:
```csharp
txtEmployeeName.DataBindings.Add("Text", myDataSet.Tables["Employees"], "Name");
```
OR, in ASP.NET WebForms:
```html
<asp:TextBox ID="txtEmployee" runat="server" Text='<% Bind("Name") %>'></asp:TextBox>
```

 📝 Key Points:
✅ Best for single-value controls (TextBox, Label).  
✅ Supports automatic updates when data changes.  
❌ Not ideal for displaying multiple records.  

---

 🔹 3. Complex Data Binding
 Definition:  
- Complex Data Binding is used to bind a collection of data to controls like GridView, ListBox, DropDownList, etc.  
- It allows the UI control to display multiple records at once.

 Example:
Binding data to a GridView:
```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    if (!IsPostBack) {
        string connectionString = "server=localhost; database=MyDB; integrated security=true;";
        using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) {
            SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT ID, Name FROM Employees", conn);
            DataTable dt = new DataTable();
            adapter.Fill(dt);

            GridView1.DataSource = dt;
            GridView1.DataBind();  // Binding multiple records
        }
    }
}
```
In ASP.NET WebForms:
```html
<asp:GridView ID="GridView1" runat="server"></asp:GridView>
```

 📝 Key Points:
✅ Best for displaying multiple records (GridView, ListBox, etc.).  
✅ Supports automatic updates if configured properly.  
❌ Requires a data source like `DataTable`, `List<T>`, or `DataSet`.  

---

 🔹 Summary Table:
| Type | Usage | Best For | Example Controls | Automatic Updates |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Manual Data Binding | Manually fetching and assigning data | Full control over data | Label, TextBox, DropDownList | ❌ No |
| Simple Data Binding | Binding a single value to a control | Displaying one field at a time | TextBox, Label, CheckBox | ✅ Yes |
| Complex Data Binding | Binding multiple records from a collection | Displaying list or grid of data | GridView, DropDownList, ListBox | ✅ Yes |

---

 🔹 Conclusion
- Use Manual Data Binding when you need full control over data retrieval and updates.
- Use Simple Data Binding for single-value fields like `TextBox.Text`.
- Use Complex Data Binding for lists, tables, and grids where multiple records need to be displayed.

11.Explain the Disconnected Data Access without IDE.


 Disconnected Data Access Without IDE in ADO.NET  

Disconnected data access in ADO.NET allows applications to retrieve and manipulate data without maintaining a continuous connection to the database. This is achieved using DataSet and DataAdapter, which store data in memory and work independently of the database connection.

---

 Key Components of Disconnected Data Access  
1. DataSet  
   - Acts as an in-memory database that holds data tables, relationships, and constraints.  
   - Can hold multiple tables and establish relations between them.

2. DataAdapter  
   - Acts as a bridge between the database and the DataSet.  
   - Uses SQL commands to fill the DataSet and update the database.  
   - Works with Connection and Command objects.

3. CommandBuilder (Optional)  
   - Automatically generates Insert, Update, and Delete commands based on the Select command of the DataAdapter.

---

 Steps to Implement Disconnected Data Access Without IDE  

1. Establish a connection to the database using `SqlConnection`.
2. Create a SqlDataAdapter to fetch data from the database.
3. Fill a DataSet with the retrieved data.
4. Modify the data in the DataSet (if needed).
5. Update the database using the DataAdapter.
6. Close the connection once updates are complete.

---

 Example: Disconnected Data Access in C Without IDE  

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        string connectionString = "Data Source=SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=DATABASE_NAME;Integrated Security=True";

        // Step 1: Establish Connection
        SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
        
        // Step 2: Create DataAdapter with SQL Query
        SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT  FROM Students", con);

        // Step 3: Create DataSet
        DataSet ds = new DataSet();

        // Step 4: Fill DataSet with data from database
        da.Fill(ds, "Students");

        // Display Data
        foreach (DataRow row in ds.Tables["Students"].Rows) {
            Console.WriteLine("ID: " + row["StudentID"] + ", Name: " + row["Name"]);
        }

        // Step 5: Modify Data in DataSet (Example: Adding a new row)
        DataRow newRow = ds.Tables["Students"].NewRow();
        newRow["StudentID"] = 101;
        newRow["Name"] = "John Doe";
        ds.Tables["Students"].Rows.Add(newRow);

        // Step 6: Create CommandBuilder to generate Update Commands
        SqlCommandBuilder cb = new SqlCommandBuilder(da);

        // Step 7: Update Database
        da.Update(ds, "Students");

        Console.WriteLine("Database Updated Successfully.");
    }
}
```

---

 Advantages of Disconnected Data Access  
✔ Reduces database load – No need to maintain a constant connection.  
✔ Faster performance – Works on local memory without querying the database repeatedly.  
✔ Supports multiple tables and relationships within a single DataSet.  
✔ Good for distributed applications where direct database access is not always possible.

 Disadvantages of Disconnected Data Access  
✖ More memory usage – DataSet stores data in memory, which can be inefficient for large datasets.  
✖ Data concurrency issues – Since changes are made offline, conflicts may arise when updating the database.  
✖ Slower updates – Batch updates may take longer compared to connected access.
