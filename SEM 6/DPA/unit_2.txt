# **Consistency Checking Techniques**  

### **What is Consistency Checking?**  
Consistency checking is the process of identifying and correcting inconsistencies in a dataset to ensure uniformity and accuracy. It ensures that data follows predefined rules, constraints, and logical relationships, preventing errors in analysis and decision-making.

---

## **Importance of Consistency Checking**  
✔ Ensures data integrity and reliability.  
✔ Prevents contradictions and logical errors.  
✔ Improves data quality for analysis and machine learning models.  
✔ Helps in maintaining uniform standards across datasets.

## **Common Consistency Checking Techniques**  

### **1. Format Consistency Checking**  
- Ensures data follows a uniform format across records.  
- **Example:**  
  - Standardizing date formats (MM/DD/YYYY → YYYY-MM-DD).  
  - Ensuring phone numbers are in a consistent format (+91-9876543210).  

### **2. Range Checking**  
- Verifies if numerical values fall within an acceptable range.  
- **Example:**  
  - Age values should be between 0 and 120.  
  - Employee salaries should be within industry standards.  

### **3. Uniqueness Checking**  
- Ensures unique values exist where required.  
- **Example:**  
  - No duplicate employee ID numbers in an HR database.  
  - Unique invoice numbers in an accounting system.  

### **4. Referential Integrity Checking**  
- Ensures relationships between datasets remain valid.  
- **Example:**  
  - A foreign key in a student database (Course_ID) should match an existing Course_ID in the course database.  
  - A product order should not exist without a corresponding product entry.  

### **5. Cross-Field Validation**  
- Checks logical consistency between related fields.  
- **Example:**  
  - The "Date of Joining" should be earlier than the "Date of Resignation."  
  - Discounted price should always be less than the original price.  

### **6. Duplicate Data Detection**  
- Identifies and removes redundant data entries.  
- **Example:**  
  - Two identical customer records with different IDs.  
  - Duplicate transactions in a bank statement.  

### **7. Constraint Checking**  
- Ensures data adheres to predefined constraints.  
- **Example:**  
  - Gender field should only have values ("M", "F", or "Other").  
  - ZIP codes must be exactly 6 digits long in India.  

### **8. Completeness Checking**  
- Verifies that no essential data fields are missing.  
- **Example:**  
  - A customer's email should not be blank in an e-commerce database.  
  - An employee record should always include a department assignment.  

### **9. Consistency Across Multiple Systems**  
- Ensures data consistency across different databases or applications.  
- **Example:**  
  - A customer’s address should match in both the CRM and the billing system.  
  - Inventory count in the warehouse should match the records in the sales database.
