✔ Fills missing values using **similar data points** from K-nearest neighbors.  
✔ Works well for datasets with relationships between variables.  
📌 *Example:* If a student’s test score is missing, it is estimated using scores from **similar students**.  

📌 **c) Regression Imputation**  
✔ Uses a regression model to predict missing values based on other features.  
✔ More accurate but complex.  
📌 *Example:* Missing salary data is predicted using **age, education, and experience.**  

📌 **d) Forward/Backward Fill (For Time-Series Data)**  
✔ **Forward Fill:** Fills missing values with the **previous** available value.  
✔ **Backward Fill:** Fills missing values with the **next** available value.  
📌 *Example:* Missing temperature data for 3 PM is filled using **2 PM’s temperature.**  

---

### **3. Advanced Methods**  
📌 **a) Multiple Imputation**  
✔ Generates multiple estimates for missing values and averages them.  
✔ More accurate but computationally expensive.  

📌 **b) Deep Learning-Based Imputation**  
✔ Uses AI models like **Autoencoders** to predict missing values.  
✔ Best for large and complex datasets.
